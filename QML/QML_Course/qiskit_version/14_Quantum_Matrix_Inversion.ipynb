    "The [HHL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_systems_of_equations) underlies many quantum machine learning protocols, but it is a highly nontrivial algorithm with lots of conditions. In this notebook, we implement the algorithm to gain a better understanding of how it works and when it works efficiently. The notebook is derived from the [computational appendix](https://gitlab.com/apozas/bayesian-dl-quantum) of the paper [Bayesian Deep Learning on a Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11463). We restrict our attention to inverting a $2\\times 2$ matrix, following Pan *et al*.'s implementation [[1](#1)] of the algorithm."

    "Now, there is an often overlooked step that maps the amplitude of $\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right\\rangle$ onto $|1/\\lambda_i\\rangle$ This step has two caveats, in general this will be an approximation depending on the number of qbits available for the eigenvalue register, although this would obviously also be true for a classical machine. Secondly as have scaled the $\\lambda's$ to be smaller than 1, we need a similar trick for the $1/\\lambda's$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thapliyal et al [[2](#2)] have proposed a method based on long division, using a bunch of ancillary qubits for the mapping. Cao et al [[3](#3)] use a Newton-Raphson approximation to similar effect. A nice overview is of these methods is presented in Ubbens [[4](#4)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the mapping of the eigenvalues is easy, as they are powers of 2. The eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\lambda_1=2=10_2$ and $\\lambda_2=1=01_2$. The reciprocals are $\\lambda_1^{-1}=1/2$ and $\\lambda_2^{-1}=1$.\n",
    "If we swap the amplitudes of the $|01\\rangle>$ and the $|10>\\rangle$ states in the eigenvalue register, we have the mapping we are looking for, as  $2\\lambda_1^{-1}=01_2$ and $2\\lambda_2^{-1}=10_2$. We have introduced a scaling factor of 2 by doing so. As with the other scaling factors, also this one will need to be corrected for classically at the end of the computation\n",
