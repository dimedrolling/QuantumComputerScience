    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum Fourier transform and quantum phase estimation provide the foundation for many quantum algorithms, including the quantum matrix inversion, which is extensively used in quantum machine learning. It is therefore worthwhile developing a good understanding of these building blocks before moving on to more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must emphasize that starting with this notebook, the algorithms presented are coherent quantum protocols. By that, we mean that the input and output of an algorithm is a quantum state that we do not have classical information about. The protocol itself might use measurements: in this sense, they are not fully coherent, since we gain some, but incomplete classical information about the quantum system. We might also perform post-selection, which means that a gate is controlled by the classical output of a measurement. In some cases, we entirely discard a calculation based on a measurement output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it matter that we begin and end up with quantum states? Can't we just use state preparation starting from classical data and then perform tomography on the final state? We could do that, but state preparation and tomography are resource-intensive, and they are likely to destroy any quantum advantage. Exponential speedup can only happen if the input state is already encoded in a quantum state, or can be easily coded. This is not trivial, as in Quantum Computing there are currently no efficient ways of reading a file with input, or any efficient RAM system design. Besides, if we do a measure, we obtain only states with certain probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional problem is that the quantum Fourier transformation and other quantum algorithms similar in complexity require a very large number of gates on a large number of high-quality qubits. This is why the practical relevance of these algorithms is not immediate, but since they are the core of many quantum machine learning protocols, it is essential that we take a look at them."

    "# Quantum Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier Transform is an operation which transforms a function into a sum of complex exponentials. It is a very powerful tool in many algorithms and has widespread use.  For instance, it could be used to transform the air pressure variations of a musical symphony into a description using pure (sinusoidal)  musical notes. The transform in general is reversible, and its discrete version is a unitary matrix as we will see. This already suggests that we can turn the Fourier transform into a quantum algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm changes the state of the input qubits so that the coefficient of the output state are the Fourier transform of the input coefficients. The problem we signaled above is that, being the output a quantum state, there is no way of accessing these values directly. Rather, only one of the possible output states is observed, with a probability equal to the square of the absolute value of its coefficient. \n",

    "The quantum Fourier transform is a quantum algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction. The exposition here follows the introduction in [[1](#1)]. \n",

    "The classical discrete Fourier transform acts on a vector $\\vec{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix}$ and maps it to the vector $\\vec{y}=\\begin{bmatrix}y_0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix}$, where $y_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}x_je^{ \\boldsymbol{2\\pi i} \\frac{jk}{N}}$.\n",

    "To derive a circuit for a power of two $N=2^n$, consider the transform acts on the state $| x \\rangle = | x_1...x_n \\rangle$ where $x_1$ is the most significant bit, unlike the usual convention followed in the course.
